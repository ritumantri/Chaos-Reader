            <p>The word "chaos" has a robust history of meaning, going back to a Greek poet who used it to refer to "emptiness," or to "a gaping hole." According to "Theogony," Hesiod's eighth century B.C. account of the beginnings of the cosmos and of the origins of the gods, chaos, as Adluri interprets it, is a primordial space of potentiality. But the Greek term "kosmos," which we now typically translate as "cosmos" meant, literally, "embellishment," "ornament." It meant a pleasant arrangement, or, to put it another way: it meant order. The Greek view of an ordered universe stood in contrast to the earlier view, still known to the Pre-Socratics and the tragedians, of a disorderly beginning.</p>

            <p>The question I asked myself was: What does it mean to suggest that someone descended into chaos? What does it mean to say that social order broke down? I took the contemporary usage of the term to mean, roughly, "disorder." But this was not the way Hesiod used the term. Chaos, for the ancient Greeks, is a word full of philosophical and theological meaning. As Adluri put it to me: "For Hesiod, and for Greek religion generally, chaos stood for a primordial gap separating heaven and earth, out of which creation issued forth. It's not so much disorder, but an emptiness or gaping hole."</p>

            <p>As Adluri walked me through the ancient Greek understanding of chaos, I was struck by how chaos was intertwined with order, and even a kind of beauty. From this primordial emptiness, the cosmos emerged. In our contemporary usage, chaos and order are stark opposites. So to understand the ancient Greek concept of chaos more fully, I turned to classicist Olga Levaniouk, whose first language is Russian. She described Greek "chaos" as "a place you can fall into, where the bottom falls out." I was reminded of our contemporary phrase "existential void." I think here of the psychic space of a terror attack or the aftermath of personal loss, but also the Greek tragedians' view of indifferent forces, of matter-of-fact catastrophes, of ironies that look too much like cruelties.</p>

        <div class="chaos-zone zone-4">
            <p>As Levaniouk walked me through the historical shift in the idea of chaos from something closer to "opening" or "gap" to "disorder," she warned that our contemporary ways of talking about chaos in the social world can obscure reality. She said, "When we hear people use 'chaos,' I think we need to ask: Whose chaos? And what does it mean?" In the social world, people sometimes use the idea of chaos to describe things that feel disturbing to them, and to underscore feelings of fear, powerlessness or disorientation. However, a moment that looks like pure disorder to one person may look like a vibrant social movement driven by shared values and goals to another person — the crowd on Jan. 6, 2021, might look like a mob to one person and to another, something quite different.</p>

            <p>The physicist Alan Sokal, known for the famous hoax that bears his name, once worried that scientific concepts had been transferred willy-nilly into the humanities, in ways that obscured their meaning and rendered them meaningless. When I asked him about chaos theory, he was quick to point out that in the context of physics, "chaos" is a term with a precise meaning — it doesn't refer to pure disorder, but rather to systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, which makes them highly unpredictable in the long run.</p>

            <p>A violent order is a disorder; and a great disorder is an order; these two things are one. If all the green of spring was blue, and it is; if all the flowers of South Africa were bright on the tables of Connecticut, and they are; if Englishmen lived without tea in Ceylon, and they do; and if it all went on in an orderly way, and it does; a law of inherent opposites, of essential unity, is as pleasant as port, as pleasant as the brush-strokes of a bough, an upper, particular bough in, say, Marchand. After all the pretty contrast of life and death proves that these opposite things partake of one, at least that was the theory, when bishops' books resolved the world. We cannot go back to that. The squirming facts exceed the squamous mind.</p>
